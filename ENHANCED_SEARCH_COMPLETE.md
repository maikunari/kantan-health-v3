# Enhanced English-Focused Search System - Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully enhanced the Google Places collector with category-based English-focused search queries while preserving all existing functionality.

## What Was Built

### 1. Master Location Data Structure ✅
**File**: `src/data/master_locations.py`

- **28 Major Cities**: Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, etc.
- **23 Tokyo Special Wards**: All 23 wards with English priority ranking
- **International Districts**: 
  - 15 districts in Tokyo (Roppongi, Azabu, Hiroo, etc.)
  - Districts for 6 other major cities
- **US Military Base Areas**: 7 locations with American populations
- **Location Validator**: Validates, normalizes, and categorizes locations
- **Priority Selection**: Auto-selects top English-speaking areas

### 2. Master Specialty Data Structure ✅
**File**: `src/data/master_specialties.py`

- **39 Primary Specialties**: Canonical medical specialties
- **100+ Duplicate Mappings**: Maps variations to canonical forms
  - "GP" → "General Medicine"
  - "OBGYN" → "Obstetrics & Gynecology"
  - "Dentist" → "Dentistry"
- **Japanese Mappings**: Converts Japanese terms to English specialties
- **Default Handling**: Unknown specialties → "General Medicine" with review flag
- **English Search Terms**: Specialty-specific English search patterns

### 3. Enhanced Google Places Collector ✅
**File**: `src/collectors/google_places.py` (Enhanced, not replaced)

#### New Features Added:
- **Master Data Integration**: LocationValidator and SpecialtyNormalizer
- **English-Focused Query Generation**: `generate_english_focused_queries()` method
- **Location Validation**: Rejects invalid locations, normalizes valid ones
- **Specialty Normalization**: Maps all specialties to canonical forms
- **Review Flags**: Marks questionable data for human review

#### Preserved Features:
- ✅ Rate limiting (2 seconds between API calls)
- ✅ Romaji converter integration
- ✅ Database connection and provider creation
- ✅ Duplicate detection with fingerprinting
- ✅ Cost tracking and caching
- ✅ English proficiency analysis

### 4. Query Generation Patterns

#### Priority 1: English-Specific (Highest Success Rate)
```
"English speaking {specialty} {location}"
"English {specialty} {location}"
"International {specialty} {location}"
```

#### Priority 2: General English Healthcare
```
"English speaking doctor {location}"
"International hospital {location}"
"Foreign friendly clinic {location}"
```

#### Results:
- Generates targeted queries for English-speaking providers
- Prioritizes international districts and expat areas
- Validates all locations against master list
- Normalizes specialties for consistency

## Test Results

### All Tests Passing ✅
1. **Master Data**: Location and specialty validation working
2. **Enhanced Collector**: All components loaded successfully
3. **Query Generation**: English-focused queries generated correctly
4. **Duplicate Protection**: 464 existing providers protected

### Sample Generated Queries:
- "English speaking general medicine Roppongi" (Priority 1, High English rate)
- "International pediatrics Shibuya" (Priority 1, High English rate)
- "English dentistry Minato" (Priority 1, High English rate)
- "English speaking doctor Azabu" (Priority 2, Medium-High English rate)

## Key Improvements

### 1. Quality Over Quantity
- Targets English-speaking providers specifically
- Focuses on international districts first
- Validates all data against master lists

### 2. Data Consistency
- All locations normalized to standard forms
- All specialties mapped to 39 canonical types
- Review flags for questionable data

### 3. No Breaking Changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- Rate limiting still active
- Duplicate protection still working
- Database operations unchanged

### 4. Geographic Exclusions REMOVED
- No 500m exclusion zones (as requested)
- Pure identity-based deduplication
- Allows legitimate providers in dense areas

## Usage Example

```python
from src.collectors.google_places import GooglePlacesCollector

# Initialize enhanced collector
collector = GooglePlacesCollector()

# Generate English-focused queries
queries = collector.generate_english_focused_queries(
    locations=['Roppongi', 'Shibuya', 'Minato'],  # Or None for auto-priority
    specialties=['General Medicine', 'Pediatrics'],  # Or None for auto-priority
    limit=50
)

# Execute searches with rate limiting
for query_data in queries[:5]:  # Test with first 5
    results = collector.search_providers(
        query_data['query'],
        limit=10  # Get up to 10 results per query
    )
    
    # Process results (romaji conversion, validation, deduplication all automatic)
    for provider in results:
        # Location and specialties already validated
        # Duplicate checking automatic
        # English proficiency calculated
        pass
```

## Campaign Ready Status
